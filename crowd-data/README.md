This is the dataset used for Section 5 of the paper "Revisiting the Importance of Encoding Logic Rules in Sentiment Classification", submitted to EMNLP 2018.

This dataset contains 447 sentences (of style A-but-B and negations), taken from the test set of Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST2). Each sentence has been labelled by 9 or 10 people on Figure Eight (previously known as CrowdFlower). Every line consists of the average sentiment score and the individual sentiment scores.

Each user has been presented three choices for the sentiment of the sentence,

0 -------- negative
0.5 ------ neutral
1 -------- positive
